This project was done as part of the Robomasters University League which is hosted each year by universities all over the United States. The robot shown in this repo is the HERO robot, the biggest and heaviest robot in the 3-robot team. Shooting 42mm projectiles, the HERO robot does maximum damage compared to the other robots and also has maximum health.
